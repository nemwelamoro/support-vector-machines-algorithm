project on svm algorithm to refresh my skills
Before building the SVM model, we need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. We will use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.
In the above code, we specified CD4.category as the target variable and used all other variables as predictors. We also specified the kernel as 'linear'.

We can now use the model to make predictions on the test data using the 'predict' function.

Finally, we can evaluate the performance of the SVM model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
